A dictionary is used to map or associate things you want to store the keys you need to get them. A dictionary in Python is just like a dictionary in the real world. Python Dictionary are defined into two elements Keys and Values.
Keys will be a single element.
Values can be a list or list within a list, numbers, etc.
- More than one entry per key is not allowed ( no duplicate key is allowed)
- The values in the dictionary can be of any type while the keys must be immutable like numbers, tuples or strings.
- Dictionary keys are case sensitive- Same key name but with the different case are treated as different keys in Python dictionaries.
